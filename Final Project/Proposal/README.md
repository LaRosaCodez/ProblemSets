# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
My Personal Website

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a web-based synthesizer.")

My project is about creating a functional and appealing website for promoting my music.

## Detail your project in a paragraph or more. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This website will be a platform for me to share my music. It will be based off the framework developed in the previous problem set with expansions such as videos, alternative links and a more complex design. This will be executed in java and html as was the case in the original problem set.

## If you plan to combine LMSC-261's final project with another course's project, which other course? Which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to LMSC-261, and which aspect(s) would connect to the other course?

N/A

## In the software world, almost everything takes longer to implement than expected. And it is common to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what **WILL** you accomplish no matter what?

A functional website featuring links to social media pages/contact info and a more stylized/complicated design.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you **THINK** you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Multiple pages and videos.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a **BEST** outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Inclusion of google calender elements or other web extensions, having it be available online.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

1. Map out the contents/formatting of the website on paper
2. Complete the framework (location of images, videos, text/border size, links, possible other pages)
3. Complete the cosmetic aspects (fonts, colors, more specific formatting)
4. Research how to make a website public

I will need to learn how to implement videos, more specialized graphic techniques as well as making a website public.
