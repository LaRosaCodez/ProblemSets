###i: The algorithm is narrowing down where Smith is in the phonebook (based on the presumption that the program knows if "Smith" is on an earlier or later page than the one being searched).

###ii: The method in which the algorithm does this is by *searching the middle page of the left or right half of the side* which the algorithm thinks the name Smith is on.

###iii: The algorithm will fail when it reaches either the **first** or the **last** page and then quit.

###iiii: If found, the algorithm will proceed to call Mike.
